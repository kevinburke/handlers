This project contains middlewares that I often found myself reimplementing
in new projects. In addition, it includes a middleware that logs in a format
similar to Heroku's, but which includes the request's user agent, and only a
single proxy IP address.

See the [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/kevinburke/handlers) for more
information and documentation.
