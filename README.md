This project contains middlewares that I often found myself reimplementing in
new projects. In addition, it includes a log format similar to Heroku's, but
which includes the request's user agent, and only a single proxy.

See the [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/kevinburke/handlers) for more
information.
